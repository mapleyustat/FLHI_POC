                 FLHI
     Fuzzy Logic Hypercube Interpolator
===========================================

FLHI is a generalized interpolator obtained by fuzzy inference rules. Membership functions, t-norms and deffuzification rule all influence the end result of the interpolator.

In its standard form FLHI is presented using product t-norm and first moment of area deffuzification. Membership functions act as interpolation kernels and determine interpolation characteristics. This allows FLHI to present itself as a common interpolator such as nearest neighbor, linear, cubic, Lanczos or a Spline, for n-dimensions.

Interpolation occurs in an unitary space which can be extended to n-dimensions, that is, an hypercube of fuzzy logic.

FLHI is made further unique by its ability to reverse the interpolated function, therefore FLHI is able to interpolate both a function and its inverse function. This feature can be applied to multivariable functions as well as single variable functions.

Other interpolators may be created according to the choice of kernel membership functions, t-norm or deffuzification rule.

FLHI in its current form is unable to interpolate:
 - Multivalued functions (only injective relationships can be mapped in the direct function, this does not apply to inverse function)
 - Sparse data (only regular or semi-regular grids)
 
Current code is presented as a proof-of-concept (POC).
